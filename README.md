# Point-to-Point-communication-OpenGL
A Computer Graphics project created to demonstrate point to point communication in LAN/WAN

The project leverages the power of OpenGL, a cross-platform graphics library, to create a visually appealing and interactive network simulation environment. The simulation includes the representation of LAN and WAN networks, as well as the ability to connect multiple users within these networks. The LAN simulation focuses on establishing connections between devices within a confined network area, while the WAN simulation expands the scope to connect devices across geographically dispersed networks.
 The user interface is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The communication process involves the transmission and reception of data packets, which are visually represented within the simulation. This project aim’s to provide a comprehensive overview of the development and implementation of a point-to-point communication system using LAN and WAN protocols within an OpenGL environment. The simulation offers an interactive platform for users to explore and understand the principles of network communication and visualize the complexities of data transmission across different networks.
 Communication begins with a message, or information, that must be sent from one individual or device to another. 
• The first of these elements is the message source, or sender. Message sources are people, or electronic devices, that need to send a message to other individuals or devices.
• The second element of communication is the destination, or receiver, of the message. The destination receives the message and interprets it.
• A third element, called a channel, consists of the media that provides the    pathway over which the message can travel from source to destination.
 The proposed structure of this project is as follows ; the user can choose whether the data transmission is within LAN or WAN. This choice is provided using a  
menu-based setup. Once this choice is completed the packet movement is shown between two buildings withing the same network[LAN] or between two distinct sources located anywhere in the globe[WAN].
INTERACTION’S PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAM:

•	Interaction is provided  using popular input device like mouse and key board are used to interact with this program.
•	Some keys of key board have specific function, as mentioned them below:
•	‘s’ to start the project
•	‘A’ about the project
•	‘q’ quit the project
•	We can interact with this program by using mouse (input device) as well ,by right clicking on the mouse the menu will appear displaying various options like 
•	About
•	LAN area
•	WAN area
•	Transfer from PC-A to PC-B
•	Transfer from PC-A to a PC in WAN
•	Quit
